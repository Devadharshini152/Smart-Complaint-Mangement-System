🧾 System Workflow
👤 Citizen Module
Citizens register in the system by providing their personal details.
Once registered, they can log in using their credentials.
After login, the citizen dashboard appears, allowing them to register a new complaint.
If the same complaint already exists, the system automatically detects and shows it as a duplicate complaint.

👨‍💼 Employee Module
Employees can log in with their valid credentials.
In their dashboard, they can view complaints only related to their department.
Employees can update the complaint status, which will be reflected in the citizen’s dashboard in real time.

🛠️ Admin Module
The Admin can add employees, manage departments, and oversee all activities in the system.
The Admin has access to view and monitor all registered complaints and their current status.
